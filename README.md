# LearningMircroRos
In this repo we will be understanding and creating new projects for MicroRos2 using differents type of boards.

## What is MicroRos?

micro-ROS is the robotic framework that bridges the gap between resource-constrained and larger processing units and robotic applications. It brings the ROS programming interfaces to these resource-constrained devices. With micro-ROS, microcontrollers can hereby be integrated seamlessly into ROS 2-based systems, therefore no longer being inflexible black boxes and bringing all the benefits of ROS technology into robotics product development. This results in reduces costs and increased development efficiency, and a full-stack robotic framework, accelerating robot development [1].


## Prerequisites

U can use the Dockerfile that I will using on 'Utils/Docker/Files' or run the program on your ubuntu machine. I will using Windows for wirte the code by running into a docker ubuntu machine.
